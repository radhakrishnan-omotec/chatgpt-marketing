Up to 36% of consumers believe retailers should strive to offer more personalized experiences — rising to 43% among households earning $100,000 annually. Yet only 12% of retail brands think they’re good at delivering personalized experiences to shoppers.

To overcome this apparent expectation gap, grocery giant Whole Foods has opened 24 Just Walk Out stores across the US. Dotted with sensors and cameras, these outlets allow shoppers to pick up their items and leave without stopping at the register. Instead, orders are monitored and charged through AI.

Unsurprisingly, the whole “leave without paying” element of Just Walk Out has won all the headlines. But from a marketing perspective, the most exciting part of the strategy revolves around data collection.

All purchases are tracked to an individual level, allowing Whole Foods to leverage AI to analyze shopping activity, identify patterns, and predict future behaviors.

This initiative also opens the door to hyper-personalized marketing: if a customer regularly buys pasta, basil, and tinned tomatoes, the retailer could serve them with a promo code for other Italian-related ingredients.","3. McDonald's: UK TV Spot
Seems like advertisers in the UK took a lot of heat for a bunch of really bad marketing ideas in 2017! This time it was McDonald’s.

It's hard to offend anyone with fast food, but McDonald’s pulled it off with spectacularly bad taste.

The spot shows a young boy talking with his mother about his dead father. Well, it turns out that one of the things they both shared was a love for filet-o-fish sandwiches."
